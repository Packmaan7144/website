  First off, it is not a we, but a me; I am a 17 year old ICT student who made this website as an exercice for web developping.
  <br />As I like longboards, I created a small online webstore for longboard products.
  <br />For those who don't know what a longboard is, here is a nice vieo explaining it all.

      Most of the images come from free image libraries on the internet, the other images were taken all around the internet.
      <br />All images were edited by me to be transparent.
      <br />If the author of any image does not aprove with it being displayed here,he can email me at: <a id="mail"href="mailto:HUKAD@student.eursc.eu">HUKAD@student.eursc.eu</a>
      <br />The logo on the top was entirely made by me, and if you click it, it takes you back to the home page.
